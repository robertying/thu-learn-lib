# thu-learn-lib-no-native

> This is a fork of Harry Chen's [original work](https://github.com/Harry-Chen/thu-learn-lib).
>
> It uses `cheerio-without-node-native` to make it run on React Native without Node runtime.

This is a JavaScript library aimed to provide a program-friendly interface of [web Learning of Tsinghua University](https://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn). Only the newest version (learn2018) is supported.

This project is licensed under MIT License.

## Compatibility

The library uses `cross-fetch` and `real-isomorphic-fetch`, which provides cookie and redirection support in both browsers and JS engines (like node).

I don't like polyfill. In case of any problems, just upgrade your browser / Node.

## Installation

`yarn add thu-learn-lib`

## Build from source

### Library version (for development or Node)

`yarn && yarn run build`

You can find the library version in `lib/`.
It can be used in web development or imported with NodeJS (with all dependencies installed).
It **should not** be directly used in browsers.

### Bundled version (for browsers or Node)

`yarn && yarn run build-dist`

You can find the bundled version in `dist/`.
You can install it as an unpacked extension in Chrome and click the `t` icon in extension bar, then execute anything you want in the Console of Chrome Developer Tool.
The helper class is attached as `window.Learn2018Helper` in this mode.
Or you can just import `index.js` with NodeJS.

Use `yarn run watch-dist` for watching file changes.

## Usage

### Authentication related (important changes since v1.2.0)

```typescript
import { Learn2018Helper } from "thu-learn-lib";

// There are three ways of logging in:

// 1. provide a cookie jar with existing cookies (see `tough-cookie-no-native`)
const helper = new Learn2018Helper({ cookieJar: jar });
// 2. provide nothing, but invoking login with username and password
const helper = new Learn2018Helper();
// 3. provide a CredentialProvider function, which can be async
const helper = new Learn2018Helper({
  provider: () => {
    return { username: "xxx", password: "xxx" };
  }
});

// Note that by using the following two methods you may encounter problems like login time out.
// But if you provide a credential provider, the library will retry logging in when failing, automatically resolving the cookie expiry problem.
// So we strongly recommend using this method.

// If you do not provide a cookie jar or CredentialProvider, you must log in manually. Otherwise you do not need to call login explicitly.
const loginSuccess = await helper.login("user", "pass");

// You can also take out cookies (e.g. for file download), which will not work in browsers.
console.log(helper.cookieJar);

// Logout if you want, but the cookie jar will not be cleared.
const logoutSuccess = await helper.logout();
```

### Content related

We currently support both student and teacher (or TA) version of web learning. To keep backwards compatibility, the **default behavior of all APIs is to use the student version**. The following APIS needs `CourseType.TEACHER` as the last (optional) parameter to access the teacher version. You **should use them when you are the teacher / TA** of one course, for you will get nothing from the student version in that case.

We do not maintain a global type in `Learn2018Helper` class, for there can be the situation that one can be a student and teacher of the same course simultaneously, on which by using different `CourseType` you can get different results.

- `getCourseList`
- `getNotificationList/getFileList/getHomeworkList/getDiscussionList/getAnsweredQuestionList`
- `getAllContents`

Note that currently fetching homework information from teacher version is **not yet implemented**.

```typescript
import { ContentType } from "thu-learn-lib/lib/types";

// get ids of all semesters that current account has access to
const semesters = await helper.getSemesterIdList();

// get get semester info
const semester = await helper.getCurrentSemester();

// get courses of this semester
const courses = await helper.getCourseList(semester.id);
const course = courses[0];

// get detail information about the course
const discussions = await helper.getDiscussionList(course.id);
const notifications = await helper.getNotificationList(course.id);
const files = await helper.getFileList(course.id);
const homework = await helper.getHomeworkList(course.id);
const questions = await helper.getAnsweredQuestionList(course.id);

// get content from bunches of courses
// the return type will be { [id: string]: Content }
// where Content = Notification | File | Homework | Discussion | Question
const homeworks = await helper.getAllContents([1, 2, 3], ContentType.HOMEWORK);

// get course calendar
const calendar = await helper.getCalendar("20191001", "20191201");
```

According to security strategies (CORS, CORB) of browsers, you might need to run the code in the page context of `https://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn` and `https://id.tsinghua.edu.cn`. The simplest way is to run the code as a browser extension (an example is in `demo/`).

## Typing

See `lib/types.d.ts` for type definitions.

## Testing

Run `yarn test` for testing. It requires your personal credential since we don't have mocks for these APIs. To do this, you must touch a `.env` similar to `template.env` under /test folder.

It's ok if you meet `Timeout * Async callback was not invoked within the 5000ms timeout...` error when running tests, rerun tests may resolve this problem. If you hate this, just add the third argument `timeout` to every testcase `it("should...", async () => void, timeout)` and make sure it's greater than 5000.
